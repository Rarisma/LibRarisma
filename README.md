# LibRarisma (Alpha)

LibRarisma aims to make random tasks in C# easier it also attempts to fix some of the personal issues I have with it and implements several extentsion methods that make interacting with files easier


### Math
 - Use Random functionality without declearing a new random in multiple places
 - Solve the quadratic formula (Not sure why you'd need this but oh well)
 - Convert negative numbers to positive (prevents square roots acting wierd.)

### Connectivity
 - Download and extract with a single command
